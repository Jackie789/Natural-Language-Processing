## Toxic Comments Classification Challenge

#### Big Data and Brews

**July 7, 2018**


In this social media era, many businesses are moving to incorporate user interaction and discussion in their platforms. However, a minority of users use the technology inappropriately, using it to threaten, insult, or create a generally toxic atmosphere. 

We work to classify these toxic comments, without censoring the population as a whole. 

We investigate ~160,000 comments, about **89.8%** are normal user interaction, and **10.2%** are toxic. The comments are classified in the following 6 ways: 
 * Toxic
 * Severely toxic
 * Obscene
 * Insult
 * Threat
 * Identity hate

Many toxic comments are classified with more than one label. The labels have been classified by human raters.
