Because, as I am most certainly aware, your life is a shitstorm of sitting in front of the computer masturbating to fictional creatures. Your attempts to get rid of me are mediocre at best. You are constantly sucking the dick of failure. You don't want a personal attack, huh? Well, too bad, Fuckcock McDickerson. You've got one. From me. You can go ahead and delete my profile from wikipedia. I'll just make another one and come right back to 'Syrthiss's talk page and insult the dick off of you. How could you shatter the dreams of an innocent eighteen year old college freshman trying to make a name for his band. Does that make you happy? Fucking with people because you're an overweight, single, old man in a dead-end job. Did you spot that perhaps someone else was going to follow his dreams and you were trying to hold him back so somebody else could suffer like you? Yes you did. I don't make empty threats, so I won't be saying anything along the lines of 'i'll hurt you' or 'i'll eat the children from within your sister's womb', but I will say that you are a asshole, son-of-a-bitch, mother fucking cock sucker.

In 2003, he was 20 years old coming out with his own singles \"\"Santana's Town\"\" and \"\"Down\"\". So yes, he is born in 1983. He really is, how could he be older then Lloyd Banks? And how could he be 22 when his birthday passed? The homie neff is 23 years old. 1983 - 2006 (Juelz death, god forbid if your thinking about that) equals 23.

      "  question on possible citation im sorry if i missed your question  i dont pay much attention to that page in response to your question  let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation the job of wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view  i havent yet worked in no original research  wpnor says that we mustnt integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research we can integrate information  so long as we dont arrive at new theories another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy the more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate getting down to details  the predators and editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source the bauer site  even if somewhat unreliable  may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about bauer im not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct however i would say that your proposed text appears reasonable the sources are sufficient  and no original conclusions are made the website takedown issue is confusing to me  but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources overall  my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better attack articles are not encouraged while we must show our subjects warts and all we shouldnt enlarge the warts  nor ignore their better features balance is a part of npov  but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources there no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war it is alleged the website takdown was instigated by bauer it isnt clear if she did  and other factors between the forum and the ip are not known it was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs i dont see how that can be objective  bauer im sorry i did not get back to you about the usenet stuff et al  but ive been somewhat overloaded at work personally  i think the article is better now than when i first saw it  thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesnt seem like a lynch mob yall are doing a good job  and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted  im glad to help and try and make the article neater  and i dont mean to sound brusque in the summary field  but there was a lot to cram in there thanks for the note  i appreciate it    i would say karen saying ive called her names is an out and out fabrication ive never done any such thing or whether its because hes been able to insult me and call me names on wikipedia  repeatedly and without consequencesive accused her and jule of carrying the water for tnh and absolutewrite and they have that isnt namecalling by a long stretch im really weary of these attacks over this this is mob rule while avi seems genuine  shes hanging with a tough insulting tribe the threats against me are real and escalating by the hour blaming me wont make my points any less valid nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd its the internet equivalent of stoning this is not a fabrication i get awfully tired of being called a troll  or part of a mob or cult or group troll  or a selfinterested partisan  or a blog comment commando  or other things i could point at if i wanted to depress myself you also made a theoretical comment about me being nosy  fat and ugly putting the word if in front of it doesnt make it any less of an insult ive tried to be polite to you  and will continue to do so  but this is the response and  please notice  like abi  avi is avraham the admin  abi the ml commenter who believes in kindness  i counseled against piling on    talk   contribs those are not ad hominem names karen yet youve linked to a thread where you and teresa caled me a psycho you should hear what she said in private when i asked not to be spoken of negatively in threads on making light its obvious you two are protnh and absolutewrite thats selfinterest and backed up by the fact that you run to her for counseling well  avi can make her own decisons about it then cant sh\n",
