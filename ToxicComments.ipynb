    "In this social media era, many businesses are moving to incorporate user interaction and discussion in their platforms. However, a minority of users use the technology inappropriately, using it to threaten, insult, or create a generally toxic atmosphere. \n",
    "\n",
    "We work to classify these toxic comments, without censoring the population as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "We investigate ~160,000 comments, about **89.8%** are normal user interaction, and **10.2%** are toxic. The comments are classified in the following 6 ways: \n",
    " * Toxic\n",
    " * Severely toxic\n",
    " * Obscene\n",
    " * Insult\n",
    " * Threat\n",
    " * Identity hate\n",
    "\n",
    "Many toxic comments are classified with more than one label. The labels have been classified by human raters. \n",

      "In 2002, Juelz Santana was 18 years old, then came February 18th, which makes Juelz turn 19 making songs with The Diplomats. The third neff to be signed to Cam's label under Roc A Fella. In 2003, he was 20 years old coming out with his own singles \"\"Santana's Town\"\" and \"\"Down\"\". So yes, he is born in 1983. He really is, how could he be older then Lloyd Banks? And how could he be 22 when his birthday passed? The homie neff is 23 years old. 1983 - 2006 (Juelz death, god forbid if your thinking about that) equals 23. Go to your caculator and stop changing his year of birth. My god.\"\n",
