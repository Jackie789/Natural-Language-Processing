    "In this social media era, many businesses are moving to incorporate user interaction and discussion in their platforms. However, a minority of users use the technology inappropriately, using it to threaten, insult, or create a generally toxic atmosphere. \n",
    "\n",
    "We work to classify these toxic comments, without censoring the population as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "We investigate ~160,000 comments, about **89.8%** are normal user interaction, and **10.2%** are toxic. The comments are classified in the following 6 ways: \n",
    " * Toxic\n",
    " * Severely toxic\n",
    " * Obscene\n",
    " * Insult\n",
    " * Threat\n",
    " * Identity hate\n",
    "\n",
    "Many toxic comments are classified with more than one label. The labels have been classified by human raters. \n",

You can go ahead and delete my profile from wikipedia. I'll just make another one and come right back to 'Syrthiss's talk page and insult the dick off of you. How could you shatter the dreams of an innocent eighteen year old college freshman trying to make a name for his band. Does that make you happy? Fucking with people because you're an overweight, single, old man in a dead-end job. Did you spot that perhaps someone else was going to follow his dreams and you were trying to hold him back so somebody else could suffer like you? Yes you did. I don't make empty threats, so I won't be saying anything along the lines of 'i'll hurt you' or 'i'll eat the children from within your sister's womb', but I will say that you are a asshole, son-of-a-bitch, mother fucking cock sucker.

In 2003, he was 20 years old coming out with his own singles \"\"Santana's Town\"\" and \"\"Down\"\". So yes, he is born in 1983. He really is, how could he be older then Lloyd Banks? And how could he be 22 when his birthday passed? The homie neff is 23 years old. 1983 - 2006 (Juelz death, god forbid if your thinking about that) equals 23. Go to your caculator and stop changing his year of birth. My god.\"\n",
